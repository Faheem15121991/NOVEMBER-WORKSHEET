Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a compiler and an interpreter? Which of them is used in python language?
ANS:
1. Compiler:
It is a translator which takes input i.e., High Level Language and produces an output of low level language i.e. machine or assembly language.

Compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors etc.
But it’s program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.

2. Interpreter:
An interpreter is a program which translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. –

It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.

Python(Cpython) is neither a true compiled time nor pure interpreted language but it is called interpreted language.


12. What is the purpose of PYTHONPATH environment variable?

ANS:PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which we can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. For most installations, we should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run. Python knows where to find its standard library.

The only reason to set PYTHONPATH is to maintain directories of custom Python libraries that we do not want to install in the global default location (i.e., the site-packages directory).

13. How will you remove all the leading and trailing whitespaces in a string in python? Give one example.

ANS: To remove all trailing and leading whitespace in a string, we can use the method strip() in String class that gets rid of both these whitespaces.
ex: '   Hello People   '.strip()

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

14. Write a python program to represent a user entered number in expanded form.
For eg: user_input = 12345
Output = 1*10000 + 2*1000 + 3*100 + 4*10 + 5*1

ANS:

15. Write a python program to determine whether the number entered by the user is an Armstrong number or not?
ANS:
